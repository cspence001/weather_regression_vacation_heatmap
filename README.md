# weather_regression_vacation_heatmap

The WeatherPy file contains visualizations of the weather of over 500 cities and the relationships in the form of scatterplots between Temperature and Latitude, Humidity and Latitude, Cloudiness and Latitude, and Wind Speed and Latitude. Those relationships are then showcased in linear regression models for the Northern and Southern Hemisphere. These charts are located within the Resources Folder in WeatherPy.

The VacationPy file contains a heatmap with the cities exported from the WeatherPy dataframe. The final map displays hotels within a selection of cities that meet a specific weather criteria. The map is displayed in the main file repository under map.png.
